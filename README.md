# Coffee-project
Coffee Project (css &amp; HTML) 
As I said I used only CSS & HTML //
I did this project after I finished my course CSS and HTML, you can say 60% from the mentor and 40% from me. //
if I made mistakes or I didn't write the code as good pls contact me and tell me how I can be good. //
Oh and I forgot to use comments because I was like copy paste, maybe in the future I'm gonna use comments
